# hello-world
first project on git-hub, using the hello world! guide.
And hello! My name is Kathryn, and you can call me ...Kathryn. E.T. is also acceptable. I recently graduated in with a Certificate of Cybersecurity at UCF and am building this github as a way to learn, explore, and practice my skills.
I've always had an interest in tech and look forward to sharing projects with you.
Thanks! Peace in Christ, Ave Maria.
